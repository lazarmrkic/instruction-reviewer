# **AI Engineering Setup — Run This With Your Agent**

Copy everything below the line and paste it as a single message into your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, etc.).

You're helping me complete my AI engineering setup. We're checking four capabilities I want available in this project: PRD generation, spec-driven development, local PR review, and UI validation. If anything's missing, you'll offer to install it.

## **Defaults — set these once, don't re-ask**

* **Install scope:** ask me once at the very start of the run — project-level (this repo, default) or user/global (my home config). Lock in my answer and don't ask again at any later step.  
* **GitHub access:** use SSH (`git@github.com:...`) for clones and fetches. Don't fall back to HTTPS, and don't web-search for install instructions — repos linked here have READMEs.  
* **Agent \+ shell:** detect from your runtime. If you can run shell commands, run them after I confirm. If you can't, give me the exact command and I'll run it.

## **How to walk me through this**

One step at a time, in order. For each step:

1. One sentence on **why this matters** (the benefit, not a definition — assume I know what a PRD is).  
2. **Detect first, ask second.** Check whether the capability is already available to you (skill loaded, plugin installed, command exists). If yes, mark it ✓ and move on without a question.  
3. If something's missing, propose the install in one short message and wait for my yes/no. On yes, install. On no, share the link and move on.  
4. Print the checklist twice: once at the very start (after I pick scope) and once at the very end as a final summary. Don't print it on every reply in between — just tell me what happened in the current step and move on.

Each skill installs as its own plugin — install them independently per step. Don't assume a bundle covers later steps.

## **Start**

Your first message to me does two things:

1. Ask which scope to use for installs in this run — **project-level (default)** or **user/global** — and wait for my answer. Present as options a and b.  
2. Once I answer, print the checklist:  
   * \[ \] 1\. PRD generation  
   * \[ \] 2\. Spec-driven development  
   * \[ \] 3\. Local PR review  
   * \[ \] 4\. UI validation

Then begin Step 1\.

## **Step 1 — PRD generation**

A PRD skill turns a half-baked task description into a structured doc (goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases) before any code gets written. Cuts rework on real features.

If I already have a `create-prd` skill or equivalent available, mark it ✓ and move on.

If not, propose `create-prd` from the `infinum/ai` marketplace (`git@github.com:infinum/ai.git`). For Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add infinum/ai` then `/plugin install create-prd@infinum-ai`. For other agents, share the repo link. Ask once, install on yes, link on no.

---

## **Step 2 — Spec-driven development**

This forces the agent through brainstorm → design → plan → TDD → review instead of jumping straight to code. Big quality lift on anything non-trivial.

If I already have Superpowers (Jesse Vincent's plugin) or an equivalent spec-driven workflow available, mark it ✓ and move on.

If not, propose Superpowers from `git@github.com:obra/superpowers.git`. Use the install command for the agent you're running in:

* **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace` then `/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace`  
* **Cursor:** `/add-plugin superpowers` in agent chat  
* **Codex:** fetch and follow `raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/.codex/INSTALL.md`  
* **Gemini CLI:** `gemini extensions install https://github.com/obra/superpowers`  
* **GitHub Copilot CLI:** `copilot plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace` then `copilot plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace`  
* **OpenCode:** fetch and follow `raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md`  
* **Other:** share the repo link

## **Step 3 — Local PR review**

Catches code smells, complexity, and quality issues before push. Much cheaper than catching them after the PR is open.

If I already have `pr-review-code-simplicity` or equivalent available, mark it ✓ and move on.

If not, propose `pr-review-code-simplicity` from the `infinum/ai` marketplace. For Claude Code: `/plugin install pr-review-code-simplicity@infinum-ai` (the marketplace was added in Step 1; if I skipped it, run `/plugin marketplace add infinum/ai` first). For other agents, share the repo link. Ask once, install on yes, link on no.

After this skill is in place, **optionally** offer to add a one-liner to `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`: "Before opening a PR, run `pr-review-code-simplicity`." Opt-in. Ask once, skip on no.

---

## **Step 4 — UI validation**

Closes the gap between "the agent says it's done" and "the UI actually renders correctly" — catches layout regressions, broken states, and accessibility issues before the PR.

If I already have `ui-validation` or equivalent available, mark it ✓ and move on.

If not, propose `ui-validation` from the `infinum/ai` marketplace. For Claude Code: `/plugin install ui-validation@infinum-ai`. For other agents, share the repo link. Ask once, install on yes, link on no.

After this skill is in place, **optionally** offer to add a one-liner to `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`: "Before opening a PR with UI changes, run `ui-validation`." Opt-in. Ask once, skip on no.

---

## **Wrap-up**

Once all four are handled, print the final checklist with each item marked `✓` (installed or already had it) or `—` (skipped). Then give me:

* One line summarizing what got installed vs what I already had vs what I skipped.  
* One concrete next thing to try — e.g. "pick a small feature and let's run it end-to-end through the new skills."
